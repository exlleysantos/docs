# ðŸ§ª Tech Getting Started Lab

Welcome to the **Tech Getting Started Lab**!

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and experimentation space for various technologies, frameworks, and programming languages I've explored. Each directory contains a simple, self-contained "getting started" guide, sample project, or proof of concept, aimed at helping others (and future me!) quickly understand the basics and kickstart development.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Find Here

- Minimal, working examples to get up and running with different tools  
- Notes and tips I gathered during experimentation  
- Lightweight setups focused on clarity over complexity

## ðŸ›  Technologies Covered (so far)

- JavaScript, Python, and more  
- Frameworks like Express, Flask, FastAPI, etc.  
- Tools and platforms like Airbyte, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.

> New technologies and updates will be added over time as I continue learning and experimenting.

Feel free to explore, clone, and adapt anything you find useful!
